# RTETRACE
Simple powershell script and exe for running sustained tracerts on multiple hosts. 
I made this for a very specific scenario in 5 minutes, so you may look at this and think it's useless and sloppy, and you'd be right.



The .exe is made with PS2EXE and is a lot slower than running the script directly, however it circumvents the need to set executionpolicy
...and its prettier.

.exe requires Powershell 5.0 or newer

# Network-SustainedTracert
Simple powershell script and exe for running sustained tracerts on multiple hosts. 
I made this in 5 minutes for a very specific and temporary scenario, mostly kept for code re-use.

This script was previously called RTETRACE and it's not worth it to change the references in the script.

# Network-SustainedTracert
Simple powershell script and exe for running sustained tracerts on multiple hosts. 
I made this in 5 minutes for a very specific and temporary scenario, so you may look at this and think it's useless and sloppy, and you'd be right.



The .exe is made with PS2EXE and is a lot slower than running the script directly, however it circumvents the need to set executionpolicy
...and its prettier.

.exe requires Powershell 5.0 or newer

This script was previously called RTETRACE and it's not worth it to change the references in the script.
